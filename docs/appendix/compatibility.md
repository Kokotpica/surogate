# Compatibility

This page summarizes practical compatibility constraints for typical installs.

## Python

The installer script creates a Python 3.12 virtual environment and the published wheels target CPython 3.12.

## CUDA

The installer selects a CUDA-specific wheel build. It currently maps to:

- `cu128` for CUDA 12.8+
- `cu129` for CUDA 12.9+
- `cu130` for CUDA 13+

If CUDA cannot be detected, installation fails.

## OS / platform

Wheels are built for Linux x86_64.
